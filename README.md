# iOS App Nanodegree: MemeMe 1.0

Repo for submitting MemeMe 1.0, a fun meme-sharing app where a user can select images and add a two-sentence punchline.

The code was developed on Xcode 11 and tested on iPhone SE, iPad Pro (4th generation), and iPhone 11.

NOTE: although the previous reviewer said the button for sharing did not include the default action icon, this is something I am able to reproduce on multiple devices on the simulator. Not sure if they meant something else. Otherwise all other comments have been addressed.
